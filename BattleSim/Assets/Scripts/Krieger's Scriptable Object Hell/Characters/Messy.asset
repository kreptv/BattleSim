  characterDescription: "Messy, as you can probably guess, is pretty gross. His whole
    existence can be summed up with one simple word: Trash. His home? Covered in
    it. His diet? There\u2019s nothing healthy in there. Honestly, Messy could live
    in a dumpster if he needed to. Despite his lack of cleanliness, he is a major
    advocate for improvement of major health programs all across the world. We don\u2019t
    know why this is. "
