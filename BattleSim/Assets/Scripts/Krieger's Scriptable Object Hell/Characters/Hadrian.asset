  characterDescription: "Hadrian is the epitome of dragon kind, that is, he\u2019s
    a walking stereotype of his species. He lives in a cycle of sleeping, eating,
    and studying in his cave \u2013 often to the terror of the nearby villages in
    the process. Very young. not even 1000 years old, and he already has the vibes
    of an angry grandfather kicking the local neighborhood younglings off of his
    yard for daring to play a measly game of catch. Some centuries back a knight
    took his eye in an attempt to be another St. George. That did not work out for
    them well. "
