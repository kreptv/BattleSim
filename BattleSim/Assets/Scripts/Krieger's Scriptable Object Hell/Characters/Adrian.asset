  characterDescription: "Adrain is kind of a moron. He\u2019s a dog, but he\u2019s
    certain he\u2019s secretly a wolf. If you listen at night, you can hear him howl
    off-key at the moon. If he\u2019s not busy pretending to be a wolf, he\u2019s
    embarrassing himself at a party. Did you know that he can eat about 47 baby carrots
    before throwing up? Well, he figured that out on a dare. Who gave him that dare?
    He did. Himself. "
