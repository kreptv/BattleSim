  characterDescription: "Lilly and Flynn are a pair of birds that cannot be separated,
    no matter what. No, we aren\u2019t lying. They were cursed by a wizard for their
    hubris when they tried to steal his magic. Anyways, the two birds function super
    well as a team, especially in combat. However, they do bicker quite a bit, and
    over the most pointless subjects. Lilly has to constantly hold Flynn back with
    a leash to keep her focused on anything, otherwise she'll go on some tangent
    about space or rocks or something. "
