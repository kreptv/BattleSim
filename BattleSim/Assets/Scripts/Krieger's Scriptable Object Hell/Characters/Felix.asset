  characterName: Felix
  characterDescription: "Son of a billionaire author, Felix has always had a comfortable
    life. As such, he struggles to understand people don't just use money to fix
    their problems. \u201CWhy do you need to plan to clean your house? Can\u2019t
    the maid just do it?\u201D is a common type of sentence to hear from him. Combining
    this with being a rather small snow fox, you would think he would get bullied
    quite frequently, but Felix never attended school, and studied at home. Felix
    is also quite introverted and shy, which made getting this info out of him quite
    the challenge. "
