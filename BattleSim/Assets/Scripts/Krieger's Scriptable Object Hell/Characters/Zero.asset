  characterDescription: "A dragon known to not do much, Zero is pretty lazy. Despite
    having the draconic abilities of flight, elemental breath, and magic - he does
    not care about combat at all. Interestingly, Zero can do tasks at a very efficient
    pace\u2026 as long as there is a more important task that he is not doing. Zero
    loves to stay in his hoard of games, which is a huge mess. Toxic marker ink is
    his favorite food, which he ate right before participating in this game. "
