  characterDescription: "Skoryx, as the name implies, is an oryx. Don\u2019t know
    what that is? Yeah, we didn\u2019t either. Turns out it\u2019s this antelope
    looking thing. Anyways Skoryx is known to be a pretty dedicated artist, painting
    great art pieces such as the Mona Lisa and Starry Night. Either that or he plagiarized
    them. He does not appreciate it when people skewer food onto his horns like a
    kebab. He does enjoy the free food afterwards, though. "
