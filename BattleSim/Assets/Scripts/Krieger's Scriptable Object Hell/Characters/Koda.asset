  characterDescription: "Koda is a very tired little guy. Despite the only action
    they are known to do is steal eggs from poor people, they get pretty tired. Usually
    he needs to actually get told to sleep when he is tired, otherwise he will stay
    up all night and crash at 2pm in the middle of a conversation. If gentle suggestion
    doesn\u2019t work, whack him with a crowbar, and he will be up and fresh in the
    morning! "
