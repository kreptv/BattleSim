  characterDescription: "Cosmos is a real star \u2013 or at least that\u2019s what
    he says. Interestingly, he appears to be a half-lion half-tiger creature with
    two tails, perhaps one from each half. Cosmos comes from the stars of space;
    some believe his parents are constellations, some believe he\u2019s a magic creation
    of earth, and others believe he\u2019s just a dedicated LARPer. Being a liger,
    he is always the \"mane\" event in battle and really \"earns his stripes.\" His
    favorite things include tinkering with technology, solving puzzles, sushi, and
    telling dad jokes, such as that last line which he insisted we include in his
    description. Sorry. "
